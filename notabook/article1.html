<div class="intro">
  <p>Born in Tehran, Iran, Laleh Khorramian is a visual artist and designer who lives and works in upstate New York. In her art practice she uses animation, digital media, and sampled audio supplements with collages, mono-types, and drawings. Khorramian approaches her work as a series of experiments with the process of chance as a starting point for discovering possibilities of the unknown.

  Laleh Khorramian is showing her work at this year’s Basilica Soundscape.

    <h2>WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO LEAVE NYC AND TO MOVE UPSTATE?</h2>
  </div>

 <div class="question1">
    <p>
      It was a long time coming. The last two of my 10 years in New York was a residency in Vienna, Austria, so there was a time of not really feeling like New York was the place for me—but I had a career, and things were rolling along, so there wasn’t a reason to get up and move. There wasn’t an invitation to leave.
      <br>
      <br>
      The recession had happened while I was abroad, and so I came back to things being very different economically. It was a number of things. I no longer had my New York gallery. I was finding myself unable to afford living there. I had a relationship end, I had been in Europe for two years… It’s completely different, and I just didn’t want to be back in New York by any means. Just everything pointed to, “Time to go. This is not the place I want to be, nor can I afford to be here anymore.”
      <br>
      <br>
      I remember I had a solo booth at Statements in Switzerland, and for a year I worked on that work. But somehow things felt off. I wasn’t connected to what I was doing. It was after that show that I said, “If this show doesn’t go in a certain way, I’m going to stop for a while.” That’s what happened. It just felt like there was something I needed to recover somehow in order to move forward.

      I ended up going to a place that was a friend’s farm. They said, “Come here. Just heal. Get out of the city.” I honestly never saw myself going back. For me, it was a permanent move to begin with. I wasn’t thinking, “Oh, how can I stay? Am I going to be able to live out of the city?” I was pretty dead set on never going back. At that time, I’d opted out of making “art” for a bit. I made a complete change. I said, “I don’t want to make art for a while. I want to leave the city. I want to de-complicate my life of needing a studio.” I was in the process of trying to do a science fiction movie that needed funding, and I decided, “I don’t want all that. I want to simplify.”

  <div class="q2">
    <h2>SINCE YOU HAVE ALL THESE MEDIUMS, I CAN IMAGINE IF ONE THING FEELS BLOCKED, YOU CAN JUST MOVE ONTO SOMETHING ELSE?<h2>
  </div>

  <div class="question2">
    <p>I do get creative blocks now and then, but then, like you said, I have other things. I do like to have a few balls rolling at once. It’s innate. I work better when I can pinball between mediums a little.
    <br>

    <br>
    Also, as non-musicians, I have a band, Bauch Bein Po, with two artist friends. It’s a really ridiculous band, and we just make really stupid fun music, and we don’t take ourselves seriously at all. We started it when I was in Austria. We made a YouTube channel with a couple of our videos. We just like making fun songs that are actually quite political although sung entirely in German. It’s completely meaningless, but when I’m blocked and I don’t know what to work on, I make a video or song or something, and it’s a breath of fresh air. It’s fun and it puts me in my place.<p>
