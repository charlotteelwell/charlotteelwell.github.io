    <h2>Taking breaks will help you increase productivity and avoid burnout.</h2>

 <div class="text1">
    <p> Everyone complains about "burnout," yet why aren't the high-powered people burning out as often? Is it possible to keep up a high velocity business lifestyle, but at the same time never wear out, tune out, or drop out? Thankfully, it it possible. And, no, it doesn't require some superhuman power or unnatural endowment of energy and stamina.</p>

    <h2>What's the secret serum? 
      <br>
      <br>Take a break.</h2>
  </div>

 <div class="text1">
   <p> One study proves this point. Researchers from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign studied four groups of people. Each of the groups worked on a brain-intensive task for 50 minutes. The group that took more breaks had the highest mental stamina at the end of the 50 minutes. Another study from the University of Amsterdam took two groups of students, both tasked with choosing which car they wanted to purchase based on a set of specifications. One group pored over the data for four minutes. The other group was intentionally distracted by being asked to solve anagrams.
<br>
<br>
    Guess who made the better decisions. It was the students who were highly "distracted" while trying to process the information. Turns out, those "distractions" were actually helpful. By using another part of the brain, the students were able to give their analytical processing skills a break, and then solve the problem with renewed energy.
<br>
<br>
    Taking a break is essential to higher productivity, energy, concentration, efficiency, creativity, and just about every other good thing that you need to survive. So, how exactly do you take a break? How often? What do you dowhile you're taking a break?</p>

    <h2>According to the survey:<h2>

  <div class="question2">
    <p>Nearly 20% of North American workers worry their bosses won’t think they are hardworking if they take regular lunch breaks, while 13% worry their co-workers will judge them.
      <br>
      <br>
    38% of employees don’t feel encouraged to take a lunch break.
    <br>
    <br>
    22% of North American bosses say that employees who take a regular lunch break are less hardworking.
    <br>
    <br>
    These statistics are really a shame because regular breaks create better employees. In fact, according to the Tork survey, nearly 90% of North American employees claim that taking a lunch breaks helps them feel refreshed and ready to get back to work. There are many research-backed health, wellness and performance benefits of taking breaks.

    Here are just a few examples of the benefits of regular breaks:<p>
